Similar to ROE, ROIC measures how effectively company management is using invested capital to generate company income. A high ROIC number typically reflects positively on company management while a low number typically reflects the opposite.  Turning to Return on Assets or ROA, Neovasc Inc (NVCN) has a current ROA of -105.35. This is a profitability ratio that measures net income generated from total company assets during a given period. This ratio reveals how quick a company can turn it\u2019s assets into profits. In other words, the ratio provides insight into the profitability of a firm\u2019s assets. The ratio is calculated by dividing total net income by the average total assets. A higher ROA compared to peers in the same industry, would suggest that company management is able to effectively generate profits from their assets. Similar to the other ratios, a lower number might raise red flags about management\u2019s ability when compared to other companies in a similar sector. Another key indicator that can help investors determine if a stock might be a quality investment is the Return on Equity or ROE. Neovasc Inc (NVCN) currently has Return on Equity of -383.11. ROE is a ratio that measures profits generated from the investments received from shareholders. In other words, the ratio reveals how effective the firm is at turning shareholder investment into company profits. A company with high ROE typically reflects well on management and how well a company is run at a high level. A firm with a lower ROE might encourage potential investors to dig further to see why profits aren\u2019t being generated from shareholder money."}, {"label": "spam", "published": "Fri, 08 Sep 2017 15:58:40 GMT", "url": "https://www.dispatchtribunal.com/2017/09/08/somewhat-favorable-media-coverage-somewhat-unlikely-to-impact-biostage-bstg-stock-price.html", "title": "Somewhat Favorable Media Coverage Somewhat Unlikely to Impact Biostage (BSTG) Stock Price - Dispatch Tribunal", "body": "\t\t\t\t\tPosted by Amber O'Connor on Sep 8th, 2017 // No Comments  Media stories about Biostage (NASDAQ:BSTG) have been trending somewhat positive on Friday, according to Accern.

An executive receiving a large part of compensation through stocks is considered more aligned with shareholder expectations of strong total returns \u2014 the reason behind a vast majority of S&P companies opting for performance-based stock grants with stock-based compensation accounting for nearly 60% of the overall payouts in 2015. Although BSTG is a small-cap company operating in United States, and may not be directly comparable to their larger counterparts, this analysis is still useful in terms of helping us understand how the company\u2019s CEO is incentivised, and the level of alignment with shareholders.    Maximum CEO Comp = (0.5% * Net Income + 0.03% * Market Cap)  Executive compensation has been a controversial subject due to its historically non-transparent nature and the influence of executive management over the board, which is set up to uphold shareholders\u2019 interests. Higher transparency resulting from new financial regulations have forced companies to disclose its executive remuneration structure in detail, offering investors some information around the appropriateness of this expense. Above is a simple equation that I use to judge whether BSTG\u2019s CEO salary level is reasonable. After inputting BSTG\u2019s variables into the equation, CEO compensation exceeds what I would expect to be a reasonable level. This is because BSTG delivered a negative income in the previous year, which makes any level of compensation above our benchmark. Generally, compared to CEO salaries of other small-cap companies, McGorry\u2019s salary is above the appropriate level. BSTG must have a good reason to be paying its CEO a sum of $562,928. Or else shareholders may be bearing the brunt of the cost.   Although the company faced negative earnings in the past year, Biostage\u2019s salary change remains relatively reasonable. Although CEO remuneration can be a useful sign for the alignment between a company\u2019s CEO and its performance, it is certainly not sufficient to base your investment decision solely on this factor. Now that you know to keep in mind CEO compensation when putting together your investment thesis, I recommend you take a look at our latest free analysis report on Biostage to see BSTG\u2019s fundamentals and whether it could be considered an undervalued opportunity.
